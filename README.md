# Material Theme for Bear Notes (macOS)

Based on the most epic theme for Visual Studio Code made by @equinusocio, [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme). It's a great theme with beautiful colors and plenty of themes to keep things fresh and current.

Bear uses XML for their themes which is easy to modify and create your own. That said, some **easy** "hacking" is involved as they do not officially support third party themes.

Instructions are included below. It's a short list, don't worry.

## Updates

**2/17/19** - Work continues. Re-doing theme structure for easier work going forward. `Lighter` will be available soon after.

**12/28/18** - I've already created themes and icons for all Material Theme variants. `Lighter` will be available soon.

**12/27/18** - Happy Holidays everyone! The Default theme is ready for use. Pale Night was slightly tweaked as well.

**12/14/18** – Work on support for all Material Theme variants has begun.. stay tuned!

## To Do - Theme Variants

- [x] Pale Night
- [x] Default
- [ ] Lighter *- now in progress*
- [ ] Ocean
- [ ] Darker

## Install Instructions

Each Material Theme variant I've created has a different name used to replace a theme within Bear itself. So far I've created Pale Night [`/themes/palenight`] and Default [`/themes/default`]

1. If open, quit Bear.
2. Go to your Applications folder.
3. Locate and Right-Click on Bear. Select "Show Package Contents."
4. Navigate to `Contents/Resources`.
5. Create backups for all `*.theme` files.
6. Copy the `themes/[theme-name].theme` files you'd like to use to this location.
7. Open Bear, go to preferences, and make sure `[theme-name]` is the selected theme.

## Icon Install Instructions

I've created Bear app icon replacements for each theme variant. The Bear developers decided to make icons a little tougher to customize as well. Thankfully, not too hard. To install and ensure the theme icon is always displayed requires the following:

<img src="http://r3v.in/W1qTze/dock-icon-2x.png" width="100">

- First, Update `Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns` with the icon files included (`themes/[theme-name]/icon*.png`).
  - Use [LiteIcon](https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/)
  - or Copy/Paste through Finder Info Panel - [Guide](http://osxdaily.com/2013/06/04/change-icon-mac/)

- Second, to work while open you must edit Bear's Assets.car file (`/Applications/Bear.app/Contents/Resources/Assets.car`) using [Theme Engine](https://github.com/alexzielenski/ThemeEngine). Be sure to replace both images in `Assets.car/AppIcon [theme-name]`.
- When finished **enable** the "App icon matches theme" option in Bear's Themes preferences panel.

## Important Notes

Unfortunately after each Bear update you may have to do this process over again. Be sure to keep these files available locally or, I recommend, to clone the repo so you can more easily keep up to date. I use this theme so I intend to keep it up to date as Bear is updated.

If I miss anything...
